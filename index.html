This thorough evaluation covers the structural, mechanical, and electrical aspects of your home. Additionally, the inspection focuses on ensuring the property is safe and free from hazards.

                        It’s highly recommended to inspect your house once you’ve collected the keys, activated utility services, and before starting any renovations. Without water and electricity, we won’t be able to properly test the mechanical systems or sanitary fittings. Conducting the inspection prior to renovation also helps prevent disputes with the developer over any claims related to defective work.
